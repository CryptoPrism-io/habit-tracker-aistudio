## Core Concepts

### Habits
A habit is an activity or action you want to complete regularly.

**Habit Categories** (7 types):
- üßò **Sadhana**: Spiritual/meditation practices
- üåÖ **Wake Morning**: Early morning routines
- üåô **Evening**: Evening routines
- üõèÔ∏è **Bedtime**: Sleep-related habits
- üìö **Learning**: Education and skill development
- ü™û **Reflection**: Journaling and self-reflection
- üí™ **Workout/Supplements**: Exercise and nutrition

**Habit Properties**:
- **Name**: Description of the habit
- **Points**: Base value (10, 25, 50, 100) earned per completion
- **Icon**: Visual representation (emoji)
- **Duration**: Time estimate in minutes (optional)
- **Streak Multiplier**: Bonus multiplier (1x, 1.5x, 2x, 3x)
- **Tags**: Custom labels for organization

### Points System
Points are earned when you complete habits.

**Point Calculation**:
```
Points Earned = Base Points
              √ó Streak Multiplier
              √ó Daily Streak Bonus
```

**Daily Streak Bonus** (increases with consecutive days):
- Day 1: 1.0x (1.0 multiplier)
- Day 2: 1.1x
- Day 3: 1.2x
- Day 4: 1.3x
- Day 5+: 1.5x (capped)

**Example**:
```
Habit: "Morning Run" (50 points, 2x multiplier)
Day 1: 50 √ó 2 √ó 1.0 = 100 points
Day 2: 50 √ó 2 √ó 1.1 = 110 points
Day 5: 50 √ó 2 √ó 1.5 = 150 points
```

### Streaks
A **streak** is consecutive days of completing at least one habit.

**How Streaks Work**:
1. Complete at least 1 habit today ‚Üí Streak continues
2. Miss a day ‚Üí Streak breaks and resets to 0
3. Streak bonus multiplies all points earned
4. Visible on Dashboard and in Analytics

### Levels
Your **level** represents overall progress.

**Level System**:
- Points Required Per Level: 100 points
- Level 1: 0-99 points
- Level 2: 100-199 points
- Level 3: 200-299 points
- And so on...

**Progress Ring**: Shows your progress toward the next level with:
- Current level number
- Percentage complete
- XP (experience points) display

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Data disappeared
**Solution**: Check if you cleared browser cache. Restore from backup if available.

### Problem: Charts not showing
**Solution**: Ensure you have completion history. New app needs data to display charts.

### Problem: Offline not working
**Solution**: Service worker needs initial page load. Visit once online first.

### Problem: Mobile app not installing
**Solution**: Use "Add to Home Screen" option, ensure HTTPS connection, PWA compatible browser.

### Problem: Dark mode not saving
**Solution**: Check if JavaScript is enabled. Try clearing cache and reloading.
